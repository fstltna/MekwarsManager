Edit "mekwarsmc" and change the settings at the top if your Mekwars server is not in "/root/MWServer".

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- UI::Dialog
- Term::ReadKey
- Term::ANSIScreen

You also need to have my Mekwars Startup Script and Mekwars Backup Script installed.

I then suggest you add this directory (/root/MekwarsManager) into your path, so that you can just run "git pull" to upgrade to the latest version as updates come out.
